## Concept for Website

A recipe website where users can submit new recipes and search for recipes by ingredient.

### Acceptance Criteria 
- A form for users to submit data
- A page showing all the data
- Semantic form elements with correctly associated labels
- A Postgres database hosted on Heroku
- A schema describing your database in your README
- Tests for server routes and database access
- Not process user input as SQL commands
- Hidden environment variables (i.e. not on GitHub)
#### Stretch criteria 
- A way to view filtered/sorted data, instead of just all of it
- GitHub Actions CI setup to run your tests when you push
